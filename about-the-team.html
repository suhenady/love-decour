									<h3>Meet Herbertta Thomas. <a href="mailto:contact@lovedecour.com?subject=Hello%20Herbertta%20at%20Love%20DeCour">Get in touch with me</a>!</h3>
									<p>Hello, my name is Herbertta Thomas. I am Co-owner of Love DeCour. I am a Proud Liberian American. I come from an amazing family full of
										Love, Compassion, Trust, and Integrity. I am the second to the youngest of 7 children. I am married to a
										wonderful man and we share 2 incredible children and 1 fur baby.</p>
									<p>Before event décor, I worked in Property Management. I am a graduate of Valdosta State University
										where I earned my BA in Political Science and my 2nd BA in Sociology. I then went on to earn my MBA
										from Keller University and a MA in Project Management.</p>
									<p>My Love of event décor started in college when I would put together events and set stage for our
										modeling organization. As the years went on I began to help set up events for family and friends and the
										joy I got from this was unexplainable. My heart would literally smile when I saw the happiness on their
										faces. I realized…that was the number one reason I liked what I was doing. Seeing the excitement and
										amazement on the faces of everyone I helped was PRICELESS. I realized that I Truly Loved DÉCOR.</p>

									<p>Hello, my name is Sonita Ricks-Duyen. I am orgnally from West Africa my mother is  Ghanaian and my father is Liberian. I spent most of my childhood in Ghana. I am the only girl child for my parents. I came to the United States when I was 16 years old. I obtained both my high school diploma and college degree in Minnesota, I moved to Georgia in 2008, and I have three beautiful children with my wonderful husband.</p>

									<p>My passion for event decoration started when I was about 12 years old in Africa. I remember gathering my friends together when we went outside to play and pretended we were at an event, and I would place leaves from the tree on the table and use my mom's utensils on the table. I have expressed my passion for decorations ever since.</p>
										
									<p>I am passionate about helping my clients turn their dream and vision into a reality they will never forget. I truly feel the fulfillment knowing that my clients are satisfied.</p>
